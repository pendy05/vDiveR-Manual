Conservation Levels
----------------------
*k*-mers are distributed into any of these conservation levels based on their index incidence value:

- completely conserved (black) (index incidence = 100%), 
- highly conserved (blue) (90% ≤ index incidence < 100%), 
- mixed variable (green) (20% < index incidence ≤ 90%), 
- highly diverse (purple) (10% < index incidence ≤ 20%) and 
- extremely diverse (pink) (index incidence ≤ 10%).
