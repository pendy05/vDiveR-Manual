Welcome to vDiveR User Manual!
===================================

.. note::

   This project is under active development. 

vDiveR is a DiMA wrapper implemented web-based application, hosted on R Shiny server (`https://protocol-viral-diversity.shinyapps.io/DiveR <https://protocol-viral-diversity.shinyapps.io//DiveR>`_), to ease the visualization of outputs from Diversity Motif Analyser (DiMA; `https://github.com/PU-SDS/DiMA <https://github.com/PU-SDS/DiMA>`_). vDiveR allows visualization of the diversity motifs (index, major, minor and unique) for elucidation of the underlying inherent dynamics (Figure. 1). 

Additionally, the R source code is publicly accessible from the GitHub repository at `https://github.com/pendy05/DiveR <https://github.com/pendy05/DiveR>`_ (distributed under the MIT license).
